## Welcome to GitHub Pages

As the first project for the nano degree as a data scientist at udacity I have been given the assignment to work on a dataset
of my choice and pose a few questions which are related to business or real-world applications.<br>

So where to begin. <br>
For starters I searched at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for a fitting dataset. I have been looking for one which has 
at least 5 features and also a feature which depends more or less on all the other features. <br>
In the end I made the decison to use the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). <br>
It has 12 columns/features and one of them is the result of a heart disease or none, which depends on the other features. 


### Can a smart whatch help you assess your probability of a heart disease?

Well what could be a business or real-world applications which is based on the probability of a heart disease? <br>
Since health insurance companies can't deny you coverage or raise your rates based only on your health I had to think of something else.
The next best thing that came to my mind then was the data a smart watch can record and which missing parameters could help it.
For starters we look at the base parameters age and sex which are often asked at health apps.
1. What is the probability of a heart disease for men and women based on their age?

2. Can the data from a smart watch (which records the heart ratio and the blood pressure) increase the accuracy of the model from question 1?

3.  Which other of the features complements the already used features best?


### What do we need to answer these questions?
For once we need a base understanding fo the dataset
